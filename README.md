# Advent of Code 2024

I used Julia for this year, and learned a lot!
Please be forgiving if you peek my solutions, as im sure they are nothing close to idiomatic.

Notes:
- Problem 17 had me stumped for several days. I did eventually figure out an efficient and direct way to reverse search through the solution space.
- Problem 19 i didnt actually solve entirely myself. I found a recursive solution (i personally have a hard time recursion) and ported it from Python.
- Problem 21 gave me a lot more trouble than i had expected. I found a [primier on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hjgyps/2024_day_21_part_2_i_got_greedyish/) for rules to find a minimal, and _still_ had trouble implementing a solution. Pesky depth-first and all.
- Problem 24 i hacked up an attempt at brute first searching, but managed to solve the puzzle "by hand in vim" instead, while my naive solution spun futilely.

### My personal results
